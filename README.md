# order-book
PyLimitBook is an implementation of a fast limit-order book for level-2 US equities data written in Python. It includes some tools to output sampled data as well as a curses-based application to view the book and move forward or backward in time.  Input files must be for a single day, symbol, and exchange.  This code is aimed at other developers looking for a limit-book implementation to include in their own trading projects.
